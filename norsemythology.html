		<h1 class = "title">Norse Mythology</h1>
		<p class = "indent">Norse mythology is arguably one of the most well-known mythologies, perhaps even matching, or in some cases, surpassing
			Greek mythology. The story of Thor, and his hammer, is incredibly well-known across the ages. Rick Riordan is also
			known for his stories of Magnus Chase, based off Norse mythology. What makes Norse mythology possibly more well-known 
			than Greek mythology is its representation in movies. Its most popular representation is in the Avenger's movies.</p>

			There are three movies produced by Marvel, they are, "Thor", released in 2011 "Thor: The Dark World", released in 2013 and "Thor Ragnock", released in 2017.
			"Thor: Love and Thunder" will be released in 2021. In the first movie, he is cast out of Asgard, and sent to live with humans in Midgard, otherwise known as
			Earth. Throughout the movies, Thor fights to save the worlds from destruction. In the movies, he is often shown as arrogant. Loki is Thor's brother, and the God
			of Mischief, and often wreaks havoc and destruction across the many realms. In the Marvel movies, he has piercing eyes, and thick armour, often highlighted in gold.</p>

		<p class = "story">Fenris the Wolf</p>
		<p class = "indent">Fenris the wolf was a creature who tormented the Norse Gods. He roamed freely in Asgard, and was feared by many. Odin, the god of wisdom, poetry, death,
			divination, and much more, was even afraid of this creature. This is because Odin was destined to be pulverized by Fenris, in the Last Battle. Although over time, he decided
			it was time to act. They tried to trick him, using a chain and a ginormous piece of meat. Yet his true strength was not accounted for. They made a tighter and stronger chain,
			and Fenris struggled to break it. Still, he broke the chain, to the Gods' dismay. They called upon the dwarves to help them defeat Fenris the wolf. Again, a constricting piece
			was used, yet instead of a piece of meat, Tyr, a brave ancient god of war, was forced to volunteer his arm. That is how Tyr lost him arm. </p>
		<p class = "story">The Grief-Stricken Story of Baldur</p>
		<p class = "indent">Baldur radiated beauty, and shone with pure joy. He was beautiful, like a sunbeam. His twin however, Hodur, was the opposite. He was dark and blind.
			Many admired Baldur, except for Loki. Loki envied Baldur, and Baldur knew this. Frigga, their mother, Queen of Asgard and wife of Odin, asked him about this. The family
			then began to try to protect Baldur. Odin, Baldur's father, rode the eight-legged Sleipnir, and question the underworld. The prophetess said that Baldur's brother will
			bring Baldur to his end, and another son will be born to avenge Baldur. Baldur was protected by everything and everyone that loved him, which was most existing beings, 
			and some of the gods had overheard this. Thus, they tried to harm him, yet no attempts ever worked. Loki was disguised as an old woman then fooled the blind Hodur. Loki helped
			Hodur knock an arrow at Loki, and this killed Baldur. The gods surrounding the fallen Baldur would have killed Hodur, yet it was forbidden in Asgard, only Loki did not follow
			this rule. The left to reach the underworld, to ask for the return of Baldur. It was discovered he would only return if every single living being would mourn for him yet Pokk,
			a giantess, refused to. Baldur's could not be returned. As his funeral boat was sent out to sea, the blazing fire it held drifted away, leaving the mourning gods in the dark.</p>
