		<h1 class = "title">Chinese Mythology</h1>
		<p class = "indent">Chinese mythology was passed down orally, through generations as stories. Yet how is it presented in media. You must have seen
			how Chinese stories are shown in media, especially the western adaptations. The main adaptation being by Disney, of the story,
			"Mulan". This Mulan adaptation was made in 1998, in an animated version, which was largely adapted by westerners. More than 304
			million dollars was made from this movie, encouraging producers to make another movie. Thus in 2004, another Mulan movie was made.
			Mulan II was officially released on the first of February, in 2005. This move strayed from the original plot and picked up right after
			the end of the first movie.</p>

		<p class = "indent">The animated movie adaptations were heavily influenced by the westerners in Disney. Thus, it was made official near the first months of
			2019. Yet in middle of October of 2019, massive reshoots were scheduled. This may alter the release date. The new movie aims to include
			more of the original story, instead of the adaptations. For example, the dragon who accompanied the Mulan in the original Disney creation
			will be replaced by an animal that more closely relates to the Chinese culture. Whether the story of Mulan is real or not is largely debated,
			yet as the conversation continues, you can watch the new trailer for the 2020 Mulan movie.</p>

		<p class = "indent">After Pan Gu, the first living being and the creator, split the enormous "egg" of chaos, four creatures emerged as well. These four creatures
			were the qilin, dragon, tortoise, and feng huang. The qiliin is a hooved creature, and the feng huang is largely known as the phoenix of the West.
			They joined forces with Pan Gu, and called, "the Four Spirits". The five elements were formed, utilizing their powers. These elements are metal, wood,
			water, fire, and earth. Five seasons were also created, which were spring, summer, late summer, fall, and winter. Five divisions of the world were also
			created, creating regions. North, south, east, west, and center were the five regions created. Each ethereal creature took a portion, or more specifically
			a fifth, of their creations. For example, the feng huang was responsible for the south, summer, and fire.</p>

		<p class = "indent">The above is a poem about the phoenix, written by a famous Chinese poet, Li Bai. This poem describes the happiness and joy the phoenix brings.
			Yet when the phoenix leaves, all that is left it the remains. Only a memory remains. Like most poems, the poem is much more depthful than this,
			but this is a summarized interpretation of this poem. The phoenix represent rebirth, renewal, and second chances. It is praised for its abilities,
			such as being able to judge one's character, and to bestow blessings on those worthy. Some tales state it only lands when something precious is found.
			For example, a man was said to find salt, by a phoenix landing the above location in which it was found. They are usually shown soaring elegantly through
			sky or sitting on rooftops or porclains. Their illustration is often drawn with the fundamental colours of Chinese philosophy. Some say that the "Feng"
			represents a male bird, where the "huang" showcases his female counterpart. It is a metaphor for yin and yang, and the relationship between a woman and a
			man. Nowadays, only one phoenix is visible, and is shown next to a dragon. These characteristics display how a man and woman relationship was thought to be.</p>
